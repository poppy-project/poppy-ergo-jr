[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/poppy-ergo-jr.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/poppy-ergo-jr/)

Poppy Ergo Jr robot is a small and low cost 6-degree-of-freedom robot arm. It consists of very simple shapes which can be easily 3D printed with FDM printers.

It works with Dynamixel XL-320 motors, and a Raspberry Pi for control.

It comes with three tools:
* a lampshade
* a graspper
* a pen holder

The Ergo Poppy Jr is ideal to start manipulating robots and learn robotic without difficulties.

It is particularly well suited for educational purposes (cheap, simple to assemble, and easily controllable) or can be a very nice desk decoration for geeks and makers...

Documentation about Poppy Ergo Jr as every projects of the Poppy platform is located at [docs.poppy-project.org](http://docs.poppy-project.org/en/).

## Build your own Poppy Ergo Jr

* You can find the complete **Bill Of Material** needed to build a Poppy Ergo Jr [here](doc/bom.md) and a list of potential suppliers [here](doc/suppliers.md).
![](doc/img/assembly/steps/ErgoJr_assembly.gif)

* Look at the [hardware folder](hardware) for the mechanical and electronics parts.

* Then you can follow the assembly instructions presented [here](doc/assembly.md) to guide you trough the process of transforming a bunch of parts in a magnificent robot !

* Once you have a ready-to-use Poppy Ergo, you can take a look at [code samples](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-ergo-jr/tree/master/software/samples) for ideas

## Setup your Raspberry-Pi board

Poppy Ergo-Jr is based on the [Raspberry-Pi 2 board](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/). We provide our own [image](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-ergo-jr/releases/download/1.0.0-rc.2/poppy-ergo-jr.img.zip) (based on Raspbian) that can be directly copied to the SD-card. You can refer to the [documentation](http://docs.poppy-project.org/en/installation/install-a-poppy-board.html) for more details. *Note that if you buy it as a kit from one of the reseller you will also get a pre-installed SD-card.*

You can also use our setup script directly on a Raspberry-Pi based on Raspbian. **Be aware tough that it takes some times and some good knowledge of Linux.** We use the [Raspoppy scripts](https://github.com/poppy-project/raspoppy) to setup the Raspberry-Pi to match our needs (custom Python, setup serial communication, setup the web interface, a Poppy user...).

It a two steps process:

* Make sure you have enough space on the SD-card (at least 2G). You can extand your partition if needed via:
```sudo raspi-config --expand-rootfs``` You will need to reboot afterwards.
* Run the raspoppy script: ```curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poppy-project/raspoppy/master/raspoppyfication.sh | bash -s "poppy-ergo-jr"```

## The Poppy project history

The Poppy project is born in 2012 in the [Flowers laboratory](https://flowers.inria.fr/) at [Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest](http://www.inria.fr/en/centre/bordeaux).
It was initiated during [Matthieu Lapeyre](https://github.com/matthieu-lapeyre)'s PhD Thesis surpervised by [Pierre Yves Oudeyer](http://www.pyoudeyer.com/). At the beginning, the development team was composed by [Matthieu Lapeyre](https://github.com/matthieu-lapeyre) (mechanics & design), [Pierre Rouanet](https://github.com/pierre-rouanet) (software) and [Jonathan Grizou](http://jgrizou.com/) (electronics).

This project is initially a fundamental research project financed by [ERC Grant Explorer](http://erc.europa.eu/) to explore the role of embodiement and morphology properties on cognition and especially on the learning of sensori-motor tasks.
